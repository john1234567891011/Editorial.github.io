      <h1 class="page title">Immigration Policy</h1>
      <p>Immigration is a major topic in current day America. Parties and Presidents each have their own opinion of immigration. Some believe that immigrants should be allowed to stay as workers and some claim that these immigrants steal the United States money. Some like Barack Obama have made programs that allow immigrants to qualify to stay in America as a worker. This program is called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and has many opinions on it. Some presidents orders give certain rights to immigrants that American citizens have like George W. Bushs Privacy act. This act enables the right that if one organization uncovers information on an immigrant it cant be shared with other organization. One president has repealed these orders and others too. President Donald Trump has some executive orders that former presidents have made.
The change Donald Trump has made is great change he definitely should keep the orders he had made.
Although there is controversy on the disposal of DACA this is a good change. The original purpose of DACA is to allow children to be able to work in america for a certain amount of time so that they can handle issues for small amount of time. But if you have eight years of working and you arent messing around you should be able to have enough money to sustain yourself back in your own country. But if you keep going on and on you basically can afford to pay for the visa but since you dont have to you dont have to spend as much and of course people are going to keep applying for DACA because they skip a safety part of coming into America and you dont have to pay  to get in. It is a better financial deal. So to keep people in Mexico, to keep the needs to live for many instead of the need of few and to keep a financial deal on visas DACA was repealed and should stay repealed.
The act that was repealed that has the most criticism is the act that focuses deportation on gang members and criminals. This act though has several problems with it. Some people that are deported because of this act arent part of a gang or have done any criminal activity. Some people have been blamed or were suspected of gang activity. If we are a country of innocent before proven guilty why do we deport people that cant be proved guilty without reasonable doubt. Also another problem with this act is that it makes more people cross the border. They think that if they dont join any gangs or have any criminal activity they are least likely to get deported since the main focus is on gang members and criminals. This is not good we want to stop illegal immigration. If we make immigrants even slightly think they can get away with crossing the border they will come across the border. Terrorists then can use this opportunity to sneak over the border. So even though deporting mainly criminals and gang members is a great idea until we can somehow make this act do its duty without increasing illegal immigration and unfair deportations.
The final act that people have criticized is the Privacy act. Donald Trump definitely does not need to bring this act back. This is why, let's say an organization discovers an immigrant has killed 10 people. They cannot share this info with any other organization due to this act. This is a problem. Now because of this act, the need of this immigrant, the few, to stay in America now outweighs the need of the many Americans to live. This privacy act changes the whole way America focus on. Let's take it in a less extreme way. If one company discovers that an immigrant illegally came into America they cannot do anything to right the wrong. The immigrant who traveled illegally into America cannot be punished for breaking the Law he broke all because of the privacy act. Now that Donald Trump has repealed this law all the wrongs immigrants have done can be shared and they can be punished for all the laws they have broken.
	Donald Trump does not need to change anything he has done in regards to Immigration policies he has created. You can tell through these three acts alone that not only does immigration affect the united states and that the current policies should stay and shouldnt change until we have a further understanding of immigration. DACA was a good program but was easily misused. The privacy act endangered the united states and made it impossible to punish the wrongs made.
